# Story 1.4: User Profile Management (MVP)

## Status: Ready for Dev

## Story

As a logged-in user,
I want to view my current profile information,
So that I can confirm which account I am currently using.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Profile View** - User can view current profile information (Email, Name/Metadata)
2. **AC2: Read-Only State** - Profile details are read-only for MVP
3. **AC3: Logout Action** - User can log out from the profile view/menu

**MVP Scope:** Viewing only. Edit Profile, Change Password, and Delete Account are deferred to Phase 2.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context

#### Data Source
- **User Data:** `supabase.auth.getUser()` for email/ID.
- **Profile Data:** If existing, query `profiles` table (though MVP might just use Auth User metadata). Use `public.users` table if defined in schema, otherwise `auth.users`. *[Ref: architecture/data-models.md defined `Users Table` as Supabase Auth built-in]*

#### UI Implementation
- **Location:** `/profile` page or a Modal/Dropdown.
- **Logout:** `supabase.auth.signOut()` followed by router.push('/login').

### Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Profile UI**
  - [ ] Create `/app/profile/page.tsx` (Protected route)
  - [ ] Display Email and UID (for debugging/verification)

- [ ] **Task 2: Logout Functionality**
  - [ ] Add Logout button
  - [ ] Implement `signOut` logic
  - [ ] Validation: Redirect to Login after logout

## Success Criteria
✅ User can see their email
✅ User can log out
✅ Private pages are inaccessible after logout
