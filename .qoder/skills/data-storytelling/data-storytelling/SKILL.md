# Data Storytelling: Making Numbers Speak

## Core Philosophy
Data isn't just about showing numbers; it's about answering "So What?". In Daticket, every chart should tell the user something about their financial habits.

## The 3 Pillars

1.  **Data:** The raw numbers (Receipts, amounts, dates).
2.  **Visuals:** The charts and graphs that reveal patterns.
3.  **Narrative:** The language that explains the insight.

## Narrative Patterns

### 1. The "Problem-Solution" Pattern
*   **Context:** "You usually spend $500 on groceries."
*   **Conflict:** "This month you've already spent $650."
*   **Resolution:** "Reduce discretionary spending by $50 to stay on track."

### 2. The "Progress" Pattern
*   **Context:** "Your goal is to save $1000."
*   **Action:** "You uploaded 15 receipts this week."
*   **Result:** "You are 20% ahead of your saving goal!"

## UI/UX Implementation Guide

1.  **Headlines over Titles:**
    *   *Bad:* "Monthly Spending Chart"
    *   *Good:* "Spending increased by 15% this month"
2.  **Annotations:**
    *   Don't make the user hover to find the insight.
    *   Add text labels directly on important data points (e.g., "Holiday Shopping Spike").
3.  **Simplified Axes:**
    *   Remove unnecessary grid lines.
    *   Use direct labeling instead of legends where possible.

## Color Strategy for Storytelling

-   **Alert Color (Red/Orange):** Use sparingly for "Over Budget" or "Action Needed".
-   **Safe Color (Green/Blue):** For "On Track" or "Good Performance".
-   **Neutral Color (Grey):** For historical context or benchmarks.
