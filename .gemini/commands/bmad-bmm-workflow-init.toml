Execute the BMAD 'workflow-init' workflow.

CRITICAL: This is a structured YAML workflow. Follow these steps precisely:

1. LOAD the workflow definition from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/workflow-status/init/workflow.yaml
2. PARSE the YAML structure to understand:
   - Workflow phases and steps
   - Required inputs and outputs
   - Dependencies between steps
3. EXECUTE each step in order
4. VALIDATE outputs before proceeding to next step
